This is a fake article generator for CNN articles (in case you haven't noticed). It was intended to be used by the organizers of Model United Nations Conferences to generate press releases for the committees based on the fake events that are transpiring in committee. For example, my school (Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology) has a conference called TechMUN which this can be used for.

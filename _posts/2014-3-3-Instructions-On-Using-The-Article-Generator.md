title: Instructions On Using The Article Generator
author: TCYRUS

This is a fake article generator for CNN articles (in case you haven't noticed). It was intended to be used by the organizers of Model United Nations Conferences to generate press releases for the committees based on the fake events that are transpiring in committee. For example, my school (Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology) has a conference called TechMUN which this can be used for.

To make your own article you can fork this and add a new post in the _posts folder using Markdown. You can specify the title, author, date, and content. You can use Markdown to make links, bold text, italic text, and images.

I, TCYRUS, coded it in Jekyll and the Source Code is on Github

This is based off the [article-generator](https://github.com/2016rshah/article-generator) made by Rushi Shah
